To increase the influence of the 
misclassified points, duplicate
them 
(i.e., Assign half of the total weights to 
the misclassified examples)

Assumption: we have a classifier 
model that takes into account the 
weights of data points

Procedure:

Assign equal weights wj to training data points

Train a classifier: assign it a confidence factor 𝛼 sub t
based on the weighted error rate 𝜖 sub t
𝛼 sub t = 1/2 * ln(1 -𝜖 sub t / 𝜖 sub t)

Give misclassified instances a higher weight
• Assign half of the total weight to the 
misclassified examples

-Misclassified points
w' = w/2 * 𝜖 sub t

-Correctly classified points
w' = w / 2(1 - 𝜖 sub t)

Weights will sum to 0.5 + 0.5 = 1

Repeat for T classifiers or until 𝜖 sub t >= 0.5

The ensemble predictor is a weighted average of 
the models (rather than majority vote)

M(x) = sumnation for all of t up to T; 𝛼 sub t * M sub t(x)
